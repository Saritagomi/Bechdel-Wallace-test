# Bechdel-Wallace Test for Data Analysis

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Bechdel-Wallace Test for Data Analysis! This project aims to extend the foundational principles of the Bechdel-Wallace test to the field of data science, focusing on evaluating and addressing gender biases in data collection, processing, and analysis.

## Overview

In many ways, data reflects the biases present in society. This project seeks to develop tools and methodologies that help identify and correct gender biases in various datasets. By applying the Bechdel-Wallace criteria to data analysis, we aim to promote more equitable and inclusive data science practices.

## Objectives

- **Develop Metrics**: Create measurable criteria that can evaluate datasets and data-driven algorithms for gender bias.
- **Case Studies**: Analyze existing datasets to assess gender representation and bias using our developed metrics.
- **Tools and Resources**: Build tools that assist data scientists in evaluating and correcting gender biases in their workflows.
- **Community Engagement**: Encourage discussions and collaborations to broaden the understanding and application of unbiased data analysis practices.

## Getting Started
